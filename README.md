# Budget-Tracker

## Description
  The purpose of this site is to provide a budget tracker that keeps the user's network access in mind. This site allows users to add deposits and subtract withdrawls from their budget, and provides them with a ledger and a graph that trackes the budget over time. This website was built with PWA in mind, which means it is using indexed.db to store a user's data when they are offline, and with built with functions to POST that data to the mongodb database once Internet access is restored. The website is also built to show the website and it's contents even when the Internet is down.
